To run the file, use eclipse for scala and import the whole project. Make sure that in the eclipse run configuration change main method
to the file you run, if you want to run Mst_nasdq.scala, change the run configuration to MST.main.Mst_nasdq. In the source folder animal.gexf,myGraph1,myGraph2,
nasdq1symbols.gexf are already being produced by the MinimumSpanningTree.scala, Mst_animal.scala Mst_nasdq.scala. To run the cosine similarity, open jupyter notebook and put the animalsl.txt, nasdq1symbol.txt in the same directory then run it.It should produce the cosine similarity file.
